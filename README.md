# Generative Adversarial Network for MNIST
In this repo you will find a simple example of GANs used for generate MNIST examples.

## Content

The content listed here is:

- **gan_real_image.png** is a sampe of 100 images from original dataset.
- **gan_fake_image.png** is a sample of 100 images generated with GANs.
- **gan_history.zip** is a compressed folder where are multiple 100 images samples from each 20 epochs in the GAN.
- **GAN_MNIST.ipynb** is the jupyter notebook used for training this model.
- **generator_model.h5** is the trained keras' generator model in case  you just want to use it.
